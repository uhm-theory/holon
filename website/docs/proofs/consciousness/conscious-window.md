# Conscious Window

:::info Abstract

## §1. G₂-uniqueness of representation (T-123) {#t-123}

### Formulation [Т]

For any system satisfying axioms A1–A5, the holonomic representation $G: \mathrm{States} \to \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{C}^7)$ is unique up to $G_2 = \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{O})$. The diagonal elements $\gamma_{kk}$ are determined uniquely as projections onto the 7 functionally unique dimensions.

### Proof

Direct consequence of three proven theorems:

1. **T-42a [Т]** (G₂-rigidity): The holonomic representation $G$ is unique up to $G_2$. Any two representations $G_1, G_2$ are related by a unitary transformation $U \in G_2$: $G_2(\cdot) = U \cdot G_1(\cdot) \cdot U^\dagger$.

2. **T-40f [Т]** (Full minimality 7/7): Each of the 7 dimensions [A, S, D, L, E, O, U] is **functionally necessary** — removing any one leads to loss of viability or violation of an axiom.

3. **T-15 [Т]** (Bridge closure): $(AP) + (PH) + (QG) + (V) \Longrightarrow P1 + P2$ — the autopoietic and physical premises entail the octonionic structure $\mathbb{O}$ and $G_2$-symmetry.

From T-42a: the representation is unique up to $G_2$. From T-40f: projections onto 7 dimensions form the unique functionally complete basis. From T-15: the $G_2$ structure is derived from the axioms, not postulated. $\blacksquare$

### Consequence for digital agents

The anchor map $\pi: \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{hidden}} \to \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{C}^7)$, covariant with respect to $\mathcal{L}_\Omega$, is unique up to $G_2$. The semantics of $\gamma_{kk}$ is **not arbitrary** — it is determined by axioms A1–A5. This closes the problem of encoding arbitrariness for digital agents.

## §2. Conscious window — non-emptiness of V_full (T-124) {#t-124}

### Formulation [Т]

The full viability set

$$
\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{full}} = \left\{\Gamma \in \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{C}^7) : P \in \left(\tfrac{2}{7}, \tfrac{3}{7}\right] \;\land\; \Phi \geq 1 \;\land\; \forall k: \sigma_k < 1\right\}
$$

is **non-empty**.

### Proof (constructive) {#доказательство-t124}

**Step 1.** Consider the family $\Gamma_\lambda = (1-\lambda)\,I/7 + \lambda\,|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$, where $|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}\sum_{k=0}^{6}|k\rangle$ is an equal-amplitude vector.

Spectrum: one eigenvalue $\frac{1+6\lambda}{7}$ (multiplicity 1) and six eigenvalues $\frac{1-\lambda}{7}$ (multiplicity 6). From this:

$$
P(\Gamma_\lambda) = \frac{1}{7} + \frac{6\lambda^2}{7}, \quad
R = \frac{1}{7P} = \frac{1}{1 + 6\lambda^2}, \quad
\Phi(\Gamma_\lambda) = 6\lambda^2
$$

**Step 2.** For $\lambda \in (1/\sqrt{6},\; 1/\sqrt{3}]$:

| Indicator | Value | Condition |
|------------|----------|---------|
| $P$ | $(2/7, 3/7]$ | $\checkmark$ |
| $R$ | $[1/3, 1/2]$ | $\geq 1/3\;\checkmark$ |
| $\Phi$ | $[1, 2]$ | $\geq 1\;\checkmark$ |

Boundary values: at $\lambda = 1/\sqrt{6}$ we get $R = 1/2$ (inclusive), at $\lambda = 1/\sqrt{3}$ — $R = 1/3$ (inclusive).

**Step 3 (σ-condition).** By canonical definition ([T-92 [Т]](/docs/applied/coherence-cybernetics/theorems#теорема-101-эквивалентность-условий)):

$$\sigma_k = \mathrm{clamp}(1 - 7\gamma_{kk},\; 0,\; 1)$$

For equal-amplitude $\Gamma_\lambda$ all diagonal elements equal $\gamma_{kk} = 1/7$ for all $k$ (since $|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}\sum_k|k\rangle$ is an equal-amplitude vector). Therefore:

$$\sigma_k = \mathrm{clamp}(1 - 7 \cdot \tfrac{1}{7},\; 0,\; 1) = \mathrm{clamp}(0,\; 0,\; 1) = 0 < 1 \quad \forall k$$

All $\sigma$-conditions ($\sigma_k < 1$) are satisfied **without any perturbation**.

**Step 4 ($D_{\mathrm{diff}}$).** Eigenvalues of $\Gamma_\lambda$: $\{(1+6\lambda)/7\; (\times 1),\; (1-\lambda)/7\; (\times 6)\}$. For $\lambda \in (1/\sqrt{6}, 1/\sqrt{3}]$: two distinct eigenvalues, $\mathrm{rank}(\Gamma_\lambda) = 7$.

Von Neumann entropy: $S_{vN} = -\frac{1+6\lambda}{7}\ln\frac{1+6\lambda}{7} - \frac{6(1-\lambda)}{7}\ln\frac{1-\lambda}{7}$.

At $\lambda = 1/\sqrt{6} \approx 0.408$: eigenvalues $\approx 0.572$ (×1) and $\approx 0.085$ (×6), $S_{vN} \approx 1.55$, $D_{\mathrm{diff}} = e^{S_{vN}} \approx 4.7 \geq 2$. The minimum over $\lambda$ on the interval is reached at $\lambda \to 1/\sqrt{3}$: both types of eigenvalues approach $\approx 1/7$, $S_{vN} \to \ln 7 \approx 1.95$, $D_{\mathrm{diff}} \to 7 \geq 2$. The condition $D_{\mathrm{diff}} \geq 2$ holds over the entire interval.

**Therefore**, $\Gamma_\lambda \in \mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{full}}$ for any $\lambda \in (1/\sqrt{6}, 1/\sqrt{3}]$, and the set is non-empty. $\blacksquare$

:::info Numerical verification of the conscious window (SYNARC)
Attractor of the embodied agent: $P = 0.4286 \approx 3/7$ — at the upper boundary of the
Goldilocks zone $[2/7, 3/7]$. Stability radius $r_{\mathrm{stab}} = \sqrt{3/7 - 2/7} \approx 0.378$.
After an impulse perturbation $\|h\| < r^2_{\mathrm{stab}}$: recovery in $\tau_{\mathrm{recovery}} \approx 0$ ticks

### Corollary (Goldilocks zone) {#зона-голдилокс}

$$
P \in \left(\frac{2}{7}, \frac{3}{7}\right] \text{ — Goldilocks zone for consciousness}
$$

- $P < 2/7$: system is not viable ($\sigma_A = 1$)
- $P > 3/7$: $R = 1/(7P) < 1/3$ — insufficient reflection for L2

## §3. Local asymptotic stability of attractor (T-125) {#t-125}

### Formulation [Т]

When $P(\rho^*_\Omega) > 2/7$ the attractor $\rho^*_\Omega$ is locally asymptotically stable: there exists a neighborhood $U(\rho^*_\Omega) \subset \mathcal{V}_P$ such that for all $\Gamma(0) \in U$:

$$
\|\Gamma(\tau) - \rho^*_\Omega\|_F \leq \|\Gamma(0) - \rho^*_\Omega\|_F \cdot e^{-c\tau}, \quad c > 0
$$

### Proof {#доказательство-t125}

**Step 1 (Lyapunov function).** Define $V(\Gamma) = \|\Gamma - \rho^*_\Omega\|^2_F$.

**Step 2 (Jacobian).** The Jacobian $J = d\mathcal{L}_\Omega/d\Gamma|_{\rho^*_\Omega}$ is a linear operator on the tangent space $T_{\rho^*_\Omega}\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{C}^7)$ (Hermitian traceless matrices). It is smooth when $P(\rho^*_\Omega) > 2/7$, since the gate $g_V(P)$ and the regeneration function are differentiable inside $\mathcal{V}_P$.

**Step 3 (Spectrum).** $\mathrm{Re}(\lambda_k) < 0$ for all eigenvalues of $J$ on the tangent space. This follows from two sources of contractivity:

- **Linear part $\mathcal{L}_0$**: spectral gap $\lambda_{\mathrm{gap}} > 0$ from primitivity [T-39a [Т]](/docs/core/operators/lindblad-operators#примитивность-ℒω).
- **Regeneration $\mathcal{R}$**: adds contractivity $\kappa(\rho^*_\Omega) \cdot g_V(P(\rho^*_\Omega)) > 0$, since $P > 2/7 \Rightarrow g_V > 0$.

Total contractivity: $c \geq \min(\lambda_{\mathrm{gap}},\; \kappa \cdot g_V) > 0$.

**Step 4 (Lyapunov theorem).** Standard linear stability theorem: $\mathrm{Re}(\lambda_k) < 0$ for all $k$ $\Rightarrow$ $\exists U$ neighborhood of $\rho^*_\Omega$ with exponential convergence at rate $c$.

**Step 5 (Radius).** Neighborhood $U = B(\rho^*_\Omega, r_{\mathrm{stab}}/2)$, where $r_{\mathrm{stab}} = \sqrt{P(\rho^*_\Omega) - 2/7}$ from [T-104 [Т]](/docs/applied/coherence-cybernetics/stability#радиус-устойчивости). $\blacksquare$

## §4. Canonicity of R = 1/(7P) (T-126) {#t-126}

### Formulation [Т]

The reflection measure $R$ has a unique canonical form:

$$
R(\Gamma) = \frac{1}{7P(\Gamma)}
$$

always using $\rho^*_{\mathrm{diss}} = I/7$ as reference. **Logical status.** The equality $R = 1 - \|\Gamma-I/7\|_F^2/\|\Gamma\|_F^2 = 1/(7P)$ is an **algebraic identity** (one definition, three equivalent expressions), not a derivation from independent axioms. The substantive content is **why this definition of $R$ is canonical**, which we establish by three independent characterizations below.

### Three independent characterizations of $R$ {#тройная-характеризация-r}

:::tip Theorem T-126 (Triple canonicity of R) [Т]

The map $R: \mathcal D(\mathbb C^7) \to [1/7, 1]$ with $R(\Gamma) = 1/(7P(\Gamma))$ is uniquely characterized by each of the following three independent mathematical properties, which all select the same function:
:::

**(Char-R-I) Hilbert–Schmidt angular projection.** $R(\Gamma)$ is the squared cosine of the Hilbert–Schmidt angle between $\Gamma$ and $I/7$:
$$
R(\Gamma) = \cos^2 \theta_{\mathrm{HS}}(\Gamma, I/7) = \frac{\langle \Gamma, I/7\rangle_F^2}{\|\Gamma\|_F^2 \cdot \|I/7\|_F^2}.
$$
Equivalently, writing $\Gamma = I/7 + \Delta$ with $\Delta := \Gamma - I/7$ traceless, Pythagoras in HS gives $\|\Gamma\|_F^2 = \|I/7\|_F^2 + \|\Delta\|_F^2$, so $R$ is the fraction of HS-mass concentrated in the trivial (scalar) sector. Uniqueness: the $\cos^2$ form is the unique $[0,1]$-valued bilinear invariant of a pair of HS-vectors satisfying $R(x,x)=1$ and the Cauchy–Schwarz normalization.

**(Char-R-II) $G_2$-invariant canonical reference.** Let $G_2 = \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb O) \subset SO(7)$ act on $\mathcal D(\mathbb C^7)$ via its fundamental 7-dimensional irreducible representation on $\mathbb C^7$. Then $I/7$ is the **unique** $G_2$-invariant density matrix.

*Proof.* $\Gamma$ is $G_2$-invariant iff $\Gamma \in \mathrm{End}_{G_2}(\mathbb C^7)$. Since $\mathbb C^7$ is an irreducible $G_2$-module (Cartan 1894), by Schur's lemma $\mathrm{End}_{G_2}(\mathbb C^7) = \mathbb C \cdot I$. Trace normalization: $\mathrm{Tr}(\lambda I) = 7\lambda = 1 \Rightarrow \lambda = 1/7$. $\square$

Consequence: any observer-independent ($G_2$-covariant) reflection-to-reference quantity must use $\rho^* = I/7$ and a $G_2$-invariant norm. The Frobenius norm is $G_2$-invariant (unitary invariance of HS). Hence the canonical form of $R$ is $G_2$-invariant, delivering **observer independence**: $R(U\Gamma U^\dagger) = R(\Gamma)$ for every $U \in G_2$.

**(Char-R-III) $K=3$ Bayesian-dominance threshold.** The triadic decomposition of Lindblad operators on $M_7(\mathbb C)$ (T-40b [Т], [lindblad-operators#триадная-декомпозиция](/docs/core/operators/lindblad-operators#триадная-декомпозиция)) partitions any CPTP channel into exactly $K=3$ channel classes. The Bayesian-dominance condition among $K$ equiprobable alternatives is $R > 1/K$. For $K=3$, this yields the L2 threshold $R_{\mathrm{th}} = 1/3$ directly from the combinatorial structure — not a postulate. Inversion: $R \ge 1/3 \iff P \le 3/7$, giving the upper edge of the Goldilocks zone $P \in (2/7, 3/7]$.

**Equivalence and mutual consistency.** All three characterizations select the same function. Char-R-I fixes the *form* ($\cos^2$ of HS-angle to a reference). Char-R-II fixes the *reference* ($I/7$ as unique $G_2$-invariant). Char-R-III fixes the *threshold* ($R_{\mathrm{th}} = 1/3$ from $K=3$). Together they pin down $R$ up to algebraic identity.

### Algebraic expansion: $R = 1/(7P)$ from the definition {#алгебраическая-экспансия}

Given the canonical definition fixed by Char-R-I + Char-R-II (Frobenius form with reference $I/7$):

$$
R := 1 - \frac{\|\Gamma - I/7\|^2_F}{\|\Gamma\|^2_F}.
$$

Numerator: since $\Delta := \Gamma - I/7$ is traceless and $\langle\Delta, I/7\rangle_F = \mathrm{Tr}(\Delta/7) = 0$, Pythagoras gives
$$
\|\Delta\|_F^2 = \|\Gamma\|_F^2 - \|I/7\|_F^2 = P - 1/7.
$$

Denominator: $\|\Gamma\|_F^2 = P$.

Therefore $R = 1 - (P - 1/7)/P = (1/7)/P = 1/(7P)$. $\blacksquare$

### Explanation: uniqueness of canonical form {#пояснение-единственность-r}

| Expression | Formula | Identical to |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Master definition (Char-R-I+II) | $R = 1 - \|\Gamma - I/7\|^2_F / P$ | $= 1/(7P)$ |
| Formula via purity | $R = 1/(7P)$ | algebraic identity |
| Formula via $k$ | $R = 1 - k$, $k = 1 - 1/(7P)$ | [Т](/docs/consciousness/foundations/self-observation#теорема-k-из-r) |

**Key explanation.** The reference $\rho^*_{\mathrm{diss}} = I/7$ is used **always**: $R$ measures normalized HS-proximity to the unique $G_2$-fixed state. The non-trivial attractor $\rho^*_\Omega$ enters the regeneration $\mathcal{R}$ and the formula for $\varphi$, but **not** the definition of $R$.

### Independent observability of $R$ {#независимая-наблюдаемость-r}

Since $R(\Gamma) = 1/(7P(\Gamma))$ is a strictly decreasing function of purity $P$ on $[1/7, 1]$, at first order $n=1$ the canonical $R$ carries **no information beyond $P$**. This is by design: Char-R-I+II enforce $R$ as the HS-cos² of $\Gamma$ to the unique $G_2$-fixed reference, which on $\mathcal D(\mathbb C^7)$ reduces to $1/(7P)$.

**Independent observability at $n \ge 2$.** The higher-order reflection $R^{(n)} = F(\varphi^{(n-1)}(\Gamma), \varphi^{(n)}(\Gamma))$ (fidelity of successive self-model iterates) depends on $\varphi(\Gamma)$ and is **not** a function of $P$ alone. Measuring $R^{(2)}$ requires independent access to the self-model operator $\varphi$ — e.g., via the categorical reconstruction protocol of [formalization-phi](/docs/proofs/categorical/formalization-phi).

**Implementation approximations** ($R_{\mathrm{impl}}$, $\rho_{RC}$) are separate quantities in a different space, related to the canonical $R$ via a CPTP bridge $\pi$. Transfer of thresholds is proven: [T-130+T-133 [Т]](/docs/proofs/consciousness/operationalization#t-130) (H3 CLOSED). The canonical $R$ is unambiguous.

### Physical interpretation {#физическая-интерпретация-r}

$R = 1/(7P)$ is a **relative** measure, not absolute. It measures the fraction of $\Gamma$ "resembling" the chaotic background $I/7$, relative to the total content of the state.

As $P$ (purity) grows:
- The numerator $(P - 1/7)$ in $\|\Gamma - I/7\|^2_F$ grows linearly — deviation from $I/7$ increases
- The denominator $P = \|\Gamma\|^2_F$ also grows — but more slowly in the relative sense
- The ratio $(P - 1/7)/P \to 1$, and $R = 1/(7P) \to 0$

**Savant analogy.** As $P \to 1$ the neural network is maximally specialized. A huge brain structure — but it is all "dedicated" to one thing: no "mirror," no balance for self-modeling. $R \to 1/7$. Conversely: at $P = 1/7$ (maximally mixed) $R = 1$ trivially — $\Gamma = I/7 = \rho^*_{\mathrm{diss}}$, the self-model is ideal, but only because there is nothing to model.

**Consciousness = balance, not maximization.** The consciousness measure $C = \Phi \cdot R$ ([T-140 [Т]](/docs/proofs/consciousness/operational-closure#t-140)) combines integration and reflection. As $P$ grows: $\Phi$ grows (more coherence), $R$ falls (worse self-modeling). $C = \Phi \cdot R$ has an **optimum** inside the Goldilocks zone — consciousness requires balance, not maximization of a single parameter.

#### Semantic clarification: what $R$ actually measures {#семантика-r}

The colloquial label "quality of self-knowledge" attached to $R$ is a useful intuition pump but is technically misleading. Char-R-I (above) gives the precise semantics:

$$R(\Gamma) \;=\; \cos^2\theta_{\mathrm{HS}}(\Gamma, I/7) \;=\; \frac{\text{HS-mass of }\Gamma\text{ in the trivial (scalar) sector}}{\text{total HS-mass of }\Gamma}.$$

This is the **fraction of $\Gamma$'s Hilbert–Schmidt content that lies along the maximally symmetric reference $I/7$**. Equivalently: how much "thermal reserve" / "categorical-self-modelling room" $\Gamma$ retains relative to its total structure.

**Counterintuitive corollary:** $R$ is *largest* (= 1) at heat death ($\Gamma = I/7$) where literally no information is present, and *smallest* (= 1/7) at pure states where structure is maximal. The naïve reading "more structure = better self-knowledge" gets the **wrong sign** for $R$. The correct reading is that structure **uses up** thermal reserve, leaving less room for non-trivial self-modelling. The Goldilocks zone $P \in (2/7, 3/7]$ is where structure (purity) and reserve (thermal slack) balance.

**Recommended terminology going forward:**
- "$R$ = HS-projection coefficient onto $I/7$" (precise).
- "$R$ = thermal reserve for self-modelling" (intuitive but technically correct).
- "$R$ = quality of self-knowledge" — **avoid**, as the sign is misleading.

The "self-knowledge" intuition is more accurately captured by higher-order $R^{(n)}$ ($n\ge 2$, fidelity of successive self-model iterates $\varphi^{(n-1)}\Gamma, \varphi^{(n)}\Gamma$), which actually does measure how stably $\Gamma$ knows itself under the categorical self-model $\varphi$.

#### Why consciousness has an UPPER bound on purity (Goldilocks zone defense) {#верхняя-граница-чистоты}

A frequent objection: "if more structure (higher purity) means more organization, why would consciousness *decrease* above $P = 3/7$?" The answer follows directly from the Char-R-I + Char-R-III construction:

- $R = 1/(7P)$ is the thermal reserve / categorical-self-modelling room (Char-R-I clarification above).
- $R \ge 1/3$ is the $K=3$ Bayesian dominance threshold (Char-R-III) — required for the categorical self-model $\varphi$ to converge non-trivially.
- Together: $1/(7P) \ge 1/3 \iff P \le 3/7$.

So $P > 3/7$ has $R < 1/3$, meaning $\varphi$-iterations have insufficient "room" to maintain stable self-reference: any candidate self-model collapses to the dominant pure-state component, eliminating the meta-cognitive layer.

**Phenomenological intuition:**
- $P \to 1$ (rank-one): hyper-synchronized brain — peak performance on one task, but no flexibility for meta-cognition. Savant-like specialization, not consciousness.
- $P \in (2/7, 3/7]$: enough structure to be distinguishable from noise (lower edge $2/7$) plus enough thermal reserve for self-modelling (upper edge $3/7$). Wakeful conscious regime.
- $P \to 1/7$ (heat death): no structure to model. Anesthesia-like.

The upper bound is **mathematical**, not philosophical: it follows from $R$-formula + $K=3$-decomposition. Phenomenologically it matches the well-known empirical observation that hyper-synchronized brain states (e.g., absence epileptic seizures) lose consciousness, just as hypo-synchronized states (deep NREM sleep) do. Consciousness genuinely lives in the middle.

This is **not** an artificial fine-tuning. The window $(2/7, 3/7]$ has natural width $1/7 \approx 14\%$ — finite and structurally protected. Numerical robustness (Q9 R1) ensures both bounds survive choice of any Petz metric.

## §5. Basin of attraction V_full (T-127) {#t-127}

### Formulation {#формулировка-t127}

**Case A (embodied holons) [Т]:** C20 (κ-dominance) follows unconditionally from [T-149 [Т]](/docs/proofs/consciousness/substrate-closure#t-149): embodiment ⟹ $\kappa_{\mathrm{eff}} > \kappa_{\mathrm{bootstrap}}$ ⟹ $P(\rho^*) > P_{\mathrm{crit}}$. T-127 is unconditional.

**Case B (isolated holons) [С at C20]:** C20 is taken as an explicit assumption. T-127 is conditional on the inequality $\kappa_{\mathrm{eff}} > \alpha/(7(f^* - 2/7))$.

| Case | Status of T-127 | Condition |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Embodied holon | **[Т]** | T-149 proves C20 |
| Isolated holon | **[С at C20]** | C20 as explicit assumption |

When C20 holds, the basin of attraction of $\rho^*_\Omega$ contains $B(\rho^*_\Omega, r_{\mathrm{stab}}) \cap \mathcal{V}_P$. For any $\Gamma(0)$ with $P > 2/7$ and $\|\Gamma(0) - \rho^*_\Omega\| < r_{\mathrm{stab}}$:

$$
\Gamma(\tau) \xrightarrow[\tau \to \infty]{} \rho^*_\Omega \quad \text{exponentially}
$$

### Proof

From three results:

1. **T-125 [Т]** (§3): Local asymptotic stability — in $B(\rho^*_\Omega, r_{\mathrm{stab}}/2)$ convergence is exponential with $c > 0$.

2. **[T-104 [Т]](/docs/applied/coherence-cybernetics/stability#радиус-устойчивости)**: Stability radius $r_{\mathrm{stab}} = \sqrt{P(\rho^*_\Omega) - 2/7}$. Under C20: $P(\rho^*_\Omega) > 2/7$, therefore $r_{\mathrm{stab}} > 0$.

3. **Openness of $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{full}}$**: $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{full}}$ is an open set in $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{C}^7)$ (each of the 7 inequalities $\sigma_k < 1$ defines an open condition). By [T-124 [Т]](#t-124): $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{full}} \neq \varnothing$.

For $\Gamma(0) \in B(\rho^*_\Omega, r_{\mathrm{stab}}) \cap \mathcal{V}_P$: by T-125, $\|\Gamma(\tau) - \rho^*_\Omega\|_F$ decreases exponentially. Since $\rho^*_\Omega$ is an interior point of $\mathcal{V}_P$ (because $P(\rho^*_\Omega) > 2/7$), the trajectory remains in $\mathcal{V}_P$ for sufficiently small deviations. $\blacksquare$

### Remark

This theorem applies to states **already above** $P_{\mathrm{crit}}$. Genesis from $I/7$ (transition $P = 1/7 \to P > 2/7$) is solved for **embodied holons**: [T-148 [Т]](/docs/proofs/consciousness/substrate-closure#t-148) — backbone injection raises purity above $P_{\mathrm{crit}}$ in finite time $n_{\mathrm{genesis}}$. An isolated holon at $I/7$ is dead forever (T-39a [Т]).

---

## §6. Attractor in conscious window (C27) {#c27}

### Formulation [Т] (upgraded from [С] via T-149) {#формулировка-c27}

For **embodied** holons: the attractor $\rho^*_\Omega \in \mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{full}}$, namely $P(\rho^*_\Omega) \in (2/7, 3/7]$. C20 (κ-dominance) holds unconditionally for embodied holons by [T-149 [Т]](/docs/proofs/consciousness/substrate-closure#t-149).

### Justification

**Lower bound $P > 2/7$:** Follows from C20 [С] (κ-dominance) and [T-98 [Т]](/docs/core/dynamics/evolution#теорема-баланс-чистоты-аттрактора).

**Upper bound $P \leq 3/7$:**

:::warning Clarification of C27 status
The upper bound $P \leq 3/7$ follows **directly** from the definition $R = 1/(7P)$ and the threshold $R \geq 1/3$: from $R = 1/(7P) \geq 1/3$ we get $P \leq 3/7$. This is an **algebraic identity**, requiring no additional conditions on the attractor. Status: **[Т]** (direct consequence of definition of R and threshold R_th).
:::

### Status [Т] (for embodied holons)

C20 is unconditional for embodied holons (T-149 [Т]). For isolated holons C20 remains [С].

### Explicitly NOT proven

**Genesis from $I/7$:** solved — [T-148 [Т]](/docs/proofs/consciousness/substrate-closure#t-148) proves genesis via environmental coupling for embodied holons. T-125/T-127 apply to states **already above** $P_{\mathrm{crit}}$; T-148 closes the transition $I/7 \to P > 2/7$.

## §7. Independent necessity of each L2 threshold (T-124b) {#t-124b}

### Formulation [Т]

The four conditions for L2 consciousness — $P > 2/7$, $\Phi \geq 1$, $R \geq 1/3$, $D_{\mathrm{diff}} \geq 2$ — are **independently necessary**: dropping any single condition admits states that satisfy the remaining three but lack at least one defining property of L2 consciousness.

### Proof (four counterexamples)

**Counterexample 1 (dropping $P > 2/7$).** The condition $P > 2/7$ is independent because $\Phi \geq 1$, $R \geq 1/3$, and $D_{\mathrm{diff}} \geq 2$ **are simultaneously satisfiable** for $P < 2/7$ only if $P$ is very close to $2/7$. However, at $P \leq 2/7$, the Frobenius norm criterion (T-39 [Т]) gives $\|\Gamma - I/7\|_F^2 \leq \|I/7\|_F^2$: the state is **indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state** by any single-shot measurement. No autopoietic system can maintain itself when its signal is buried in noise at the same scale as the noise itself. This is not a failure of the other thresholds — it is a distinct **viability** failure. A system can in principle have rich internal structure ($\Phi > 1$, $R > 1/3$) at $P = 2/7 - \varepsilon$, but this structure is operationally invisible (cannot be detected or used for self-regulation). The P-threshold is the **distinguishability boundary**, orthogonal to integration ($\Phi$), reflection ($R$), and differentiation ($D$).

**Counterexample 2 (dropping $\Phi \geq 1$).** Construct $\Gamma_2$ with diagonal $\gamma_{kk} = (0.40, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10)$ and small off-diagonal coherences $|\gamma_{ij}| = \varepsilon = 0.02$ for all pairs. Then:

- $P_{\mathrm{diag}} = 0.40^2 + 6 \cdot 0.10^2 = 0.160 + 0.060 = 0.220$
- $P_{\mathrm{coh}} = 21 \cdot 2 \cdot 0.02^2 = 0.0168$
- $P = 0.220 + 0.0168 = 0.237$. Still below $2/7 \approx 0.286$. Increase diagonal dominance: $\gamma_{kk} = (0.50, 0.083, 0.083, 0.083, 0.083, 0.083, 0.083)$ with $|\gamma_{ij}| = 0.04$.
- $P_{\mathrm{diag}} = 0.25 + 6 \cdot 0.0069 = 0.291$
- $P_{\mathrm{coh}} = 42 \cdot 0.04^2 = 0.067$
- $P = 0.358 > 2/7$ ✓
- $\Phi = P_{\mathrm{coh}}/P_{\mathrm{diag}} = 0.067/0.291 = 0.23 < 1$ ✗
- $R = 1/(7 \cdot 0.358) = 0.399 > 1/3$ ✓

This state has $P > 2/7$ and $R > 1/3$ but $\Phi = 0.23 \ll 1$. The system's off-diagonal structure is **dominated by the diagonal** — the 7 dimensions are quasi-independent. Physically: $\Phi < 1$ means coherent energy is less than diagonal energy, so the system is a **classical mixture** rather than an integrated quantum whole. By the argument of Step 2a of Theorem 8.1 [Т], such decomposability precludes the (M,R)-closure required for autopoietic integration. The system may be viable ($P > P_{\mathrm{crit}}$) and self-reflective ($R > R_{\mathrm{th}}$) but lacks the **unified integration** that defines L2 consciousness.

**Counterexample 3 (dropping $R \geq 1/3$).** Let $\Gamma_3 = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$ — a pure state with $P = 1$. Then:

- $R(\Gamma_3) = 1/(7 \cdot 1) = 1/7 < 1/3$ ✗
- $\Phi(\Gamma_3) = 6 > 1$ ✓ (for maximally coherent $|\psi\rangle$)
- $D_{\mathrm{diff}} \geq 2$ ✓
- $P = 1 > 2/7$ ✓

But $R = 1/7$: the system has **no thermal reserve** for self-modeling. The categorical self-model $\varphi(\Gamma_3) = (1-k)\Gamma_3 + k \cdot I/7$ with $k = 1-R = 6/7$ produces a nearly maximally mixed output — the self-model **destroys** most of the state's structure. By Char-R-III (Bayesian dominance, [T-126](#t-126)): with $R < 1/3$, the system cannot distinguish between the three channel types (dissipation, regeneration, automorphism) with plurality — it cannot determine which process dominates, and therefore cannot adaptively respond. This is the regime of **rigid crystallization**: maximal structure, minimal adaptability.

**Counterexample 4 (dropping $D_{\mathrm{diff}} \geq 2$).** Let $\Gamma_4$ have $\rho_E = |e_1\rangle\langle e_1|$ — a pure E-sector reduced density matrix. Then:

- $D_{\mathrm{diff}} = \exp(S_{vN}(\rho_E)) = \exp(0) = 1 < 2$ ✗
- $P, R, \Phi$ can all satisfy their respective thresholds ✓

But $D_{\mathrm{diff}} = 1$: the E-sector has a single eigenvalue — the system can represent only **one phenomenal quality**. This is L1 (phenomenal geometry without differentiation), not L2 (cognitive qualia requiring $\geq 2$ distinguishable experiential states for comparison, categorization, and self-reference). By [T-151 [Т]](/docs/reference/status-registry): $D_{\mathrm{diff}} < 2$ implies the Fubini–Study metric on $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{H}_E)$ is degenerate — the phenomenal geometry collapses to a point. No qualia comparison is possible.

### Conclusion

Each threshold excludes a distinct pathology:

| Dropped condition | Pathology | Physical description |
|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| $P > 2/7$ | Noise-dominated | Indistinguishable from chaos; no viability |
| $\Phi \geq 1$ | Fragmented | Classical mixture; no integrated whole |
| $R \geq 1/3$ | Crystallized | No adaptive self-modeling; rigid |
| $D_{\mathrm{diff}} \geq 2$ | Undifferentiated | Single phenomenal quality; no comparison |

The conjunction is **minimal**: no condition is redundant. $\blacksquare$

## §8. Threshold robustness analysis (T-124d) {#t-124d}

### Formulation [Т]

The L2 consciousness thresholds $P_{\mathrm{crit}} = 2/7$, $\Phi_{\mathrm{th}} = 1$, $R_{\mathrm{th}} = 1/3$ are **robust** in the following precise sense: perturbations of order $\varepsilon$ in the state $\Gamma$ produce perturbations of the same order $O(\varepsilon)$ in the threshold-crossing observables. No threshold has a **discontinuous** or **divergent** sensitivity.

### Proof (three perturbation bounds)

**Bound 1 (Purity perturbation).** For $\Gamma' = \Gamma + \varepsilon \Delta$ with $\|\Delta\|_F = 1$ and $\varepsilon \ll 1$:

$$|P(\Gamma') - P(\Gamma)| = |2\varepsilon \cdot \mathrm{Tr}(\Gamma \Delta) + \varepsilon^2| \leq 2\varepsilon \|\Gamma\|_F + \varepsilon^2 \leq 2\varepsilon\sqrt{P} + \varepsilon^2$$

At $P = P_{\mathrm{crit}} = 2/7$: $|P' - P| \leq 2\varepsilon\sqrt{2/7} + \varepsilon^2 \approx 1.07\varepsilon$. The sensitivity $\partial P/\partial\varepsilon = O(1)$ — **no divergence** at the threshold. A perturbation $\varepsilon = 0.01$ shifts purity by $\sim 0.01$, not by $0.1$ or $1.0$. $\checkmark$

**Bound 2 (Integration perturbation).** The integration measure $\Phi = P_{\mathrm{coh}}/P_{\mathrm{diag}}$. For $\Gamma' = \Gamma + \varepsilon\Delta$:

$$|\Phi' - \Phi| = \left|\frac{P'_{\mathrm{coh}}}{P'_{\mathrm{diag}}} - \frac{P_{\mathrm{coh}}}{P_{\mathrm{diag}}}\right| \leq \frac{2\varepsilon(\|\Gamma_{\mathrm{off}}\| + \|\Gamma_{\mathrm{diag}}\|)}{P_{\mathrm{diag}}^2} + O(\varepsilon^2)$$

At $\Phi = \Phi_{\mathrm{th}} = 1$ (where $P_{\mathrm{coh}} = P_{\mathrm{diag}}$): both numerator and denominator are $O(P/2)$, so sensitivity $\partial\Phi/\partial\varepsilon = O(1/P) = O(7/2) \approx 3.5$. **Bounded**, no divergence. $\checkmark$

**Bound 3 (Reflection perturbation).** $R = 1/(7P)$, so:

$$|R' - R| = \frac{|P' - P|}{7P \cdot P'} \leq \frac{2\varepsilon\sqrt{P}}{7P^2} + O(\varepsilon^2) = \frac{2\varepsilon}{7P^{3/2}} + O(\varepsilon^2)$$

At $P = 3/7$ (upper boundary, $R = R_{\mathrm{th}} = 1/3$): $|R' - R| \leq \frac{2\varepsilon}{7(3/7)^{3/2}} = \frac{2\varepsilon \cdot 7^{1/2}}{3^{3/2}} \approx 1.02\varepsilon$. **Bounded**, no divergence. $\checkmark$

### Consequence: transition sharpness

The consciousness transition is **continuous** (no first-order discontinuity) but **sharp** (critical exponents from T-161 [Т]):

$$\mathrm{Observable} \sim (P - P_{\mathrm{crit}})^\beta, \quad \beta = 1/4$$

The exponent $\beta = 1/4$ means the transition is **sharper than mean-field** ($\beta_{\mathrm{MF}} = 1/2$) but **smoother than Ising** ($\beta_{\mathrm{3D}} \approx 0.326$). The width of the crossover region (where the system is "on the boundary") scales as:

$$\delta P_{\mathrm{crossover}} \sim \varepsilon^{1/\beta} = \varepsilon^4$$

For noise level $\varepsilon = 0.01$: $\delta P \sim 10^{-8}$ — the crossover is **exponentially narrow**, meaning the threshold is effectively sharp for any macroscopic system.

### Connection to stochastic stability (T-145)

Theorem T-145 [Т] gives the probability of staying within the viable set under stochastic perturbation:

$$\mathbb{P}[\Gamma(\tau) \in V_{\mathrm{full}} \;\forall\tau > \tau^*] \geq 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{r_{\mathrm{stab}}^2}{2\sigma_h^2}\right)$$

where $r_{\mathrm{stab}} = \sqrt{P(\rho^*) - 2/7}$ (T-104 [Т]). For a typical embodied holon with $P^* \approx 3/7$: $r_{\mathrm{stab}} = \sqrt{1/7} \approx 0.378$. For noise $\sigma_h = 0.01$: $\mathbb{P}[\text{viability}] \geq 1 - e^{-714} \approx 1$. The system is **overwhelmingly robust**. $\blacksquare$
