# Structural Derivation of N = 7 via Octonions

## Methodology and status markers

:::warning Status markers for statements
Each statement is marked with one of three statuses:
- **[T]** — **Theorem**: proven in pure mathematics or derived from axioms
- **[C]** — **Consequence**: logically follows from [T]
- **[I]** — **Interpretation**: substantive connection with UHM
:::

:::info Dual-track status of N = 7: the number and the structure
The dimensionality $N = 7$ and its algebraic structure are established by **two tracks with distinct, complementary roles**:

| Track | Delivers | Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Track A** | The **number**: $N = 7$ | [Axiom 3](../../core/foundations/axiom-omega#аксиоматика) + [Theorem S](./theorem-minimality-7): (AP)+(PH)+(QG) → 7 functionally independent aspects → $N \geq 7$, minimality → $N = 7$ | [T] |
| **Track B** | The **structure**: Fano/octonionic, P1 + P2 | The T15 bridge chain (this document): given $N = 7$ (consumed from Track A at [Step T8](#шаг-t8)), (AP)+(PH)+(QG)+(V) force the Fano organization BIBD$(7,3,1)$ and hence the octonionic algebra $\mathbb{O}$ | [Т given Track A] |
| **Consistency closure** | $\dim \mathrm{Im}(\mathbb{O}) = 8 - 1 = 7$ | The structure returned by Track B has imaginary dimension exactly $7$ — the loop closes on the same number Track A supplied | [T] |

Track A proves the *number*; Track B proves the *structure* of the $N=7$ system; the octonionic closure confirms the two are one coherent whole. (Track B is **not** a second independent derivation of the number — its Step T8 takes $N = 7$ as input; what it derives independently is that the seven-dimensional system is forced to be Fano/octonionic.) The bridge is **[T]** — [fully closed](#мост). A genuinely *independent* second derivation of the number does exist, from another direction entirely: **Theorem Σ** ([T-224](/docs/applied/research/syndrome-calculus#t-224)) forces $N = 7$ from perfect single-fault diagnosability alone, consuming nothing from Track A — and [T-244](/docs/applied/research/syndrome-calculus#отбор-знака) proves that this diagnosability track and Track B are *one* condition (a frame is perfectly diagnosable exactly when it is a division algebra), so the closure loop is not merely consistent but forced from both ends.

## §1. Pure Mathematics [T] {#чистая-математика}

### 1.1 Hurwitz Theorem (1898) [T] {#теорема-гурвица}

**Theorem (Hurwitz).** Normed division algebras over $\mathbb{R}$ exist only in dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 8:

$$
\mathbb{R}, \quad \mathbb{C}, \quad \mathbb{H}, \quad \mathbb{O}
$$

No others exist.

**Proof:** Classical — via quadratic forms and the Hurwitz identity. An algebra $\mathcal{A}$ with norm $|ab| = |a||b|$ requires that $n = \dim(\mathcal{A})$ satisfy the sum-of-squares identity. By the Hurwitz theorem this is only possible for $n \in \{1, 2, 4, 8\}$.

### 1.2 Adams Theorem (1960) [T] {#теорема-адамса}

**Theorem (Adams).** The sphere $S^{n-1}$ admits an $H$-space structure (continuous multiplication with a unit) if and only if $n \in \{1, 2, 4, 8\}$.

**Equivalent formulation:** Parallelizable spheres are only $S^0, S^1, S^3, S^7$.

**Corollary:** The imaginary unit sphere in $\text{Im}(\mathcal{A})$ for a division algebra $\mathcal{A}$ is $S^{n-2}$, parallelizable only for $n \in \{1, 2, 4, 8\}$.

### 1.3 Cayley–Dickson Construction [T] {#кэли-диксон}

Division algebras form a chain of doublings:

$$
\mathbb{R} \xrightarrow{\text{CD}} \mathbb{C} \xrightarrow{\text{CD}} \mathbb{H} \xrightarrow{\text{CD}} \mathbb{O} \xrightarrow{\text{CD}} \mathbb{S}
$$

| Algebra | dim | Commutativity | Associativity | Alternativity | Divisibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $\mathbb{R}$ | 1 | + | + | + | + |
| $\mathbb{C}$ | 2 | + | + | + | + |
| $\mathbb{H}$ | 4 | — | + | + | + |
| $\mathbb{O}$ | 8 | — | — | + | + |
| $\mathbb{S}$ | 16 | — | — | — | — |

**Cayley–Dickson boundary [T]:** At each step an algebraic property is lost. $\mathbb{O}$ is the last division algebra. Sedenions $\mathbb{S}$ and all further doublings contain zero divisors.

### 1.4 Octonions $\mathbb{O}$ [T] {#октонионы}

**Definition.** Octonions are the 8-dimensional normed division algebra over $\mathbb{R}$:

$$
\mathbb{O} = \{a_0 + a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + \cdots + a_7 e_7 \mid a_i \in \mathbb{R}\}
$$

where $e_1, \ldots, e_7$ are imaginary units.

**Multiplication table** is defined by 7 associative triples (cycles of the Fano plane):

$$
e_i \cdot e_j = -\delta_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ijk} e_k
$$

where $\varepsilon_{ijk}$ is the fully antisymmetric tensor, nonzero on the 7 Fano triples.

**Key properties:**
- **Non-associativity:** $(e_i e_j) e_k \neq e_i (e_j e_k)$ in general
- **Alternativity:** $x(xy) = x^2 y$ and $(xy)y = x y^2$ (Artin's theorem)
- **Norm:** $|xy| = |x||y|$ (normed division algebra)

### 1.5 Fano Plane PG(2,2) [T] {#плоскость-фано}

**Definition.** The Fano plane is the minimal finite projective plane with 7 points and 7 lines.

```
        e₁
       / \
      /   \
    e₃—--e₂
    / \ ○ / \
   /   \ /   \
  e₅—e₆—e₄
       |
       e₇
```

**Properties [T]:**
- 7 points, 7 lines
- Each line contains 3 points
- Each point lies on 3 lines
- Through any 2 points there passes exactly 1 line
- Automorphism group: $\text{Aut}(\text{PG}(2,2)) = GL(3, \mathbb{F}_2) \cong PSL(2,7)$, order 168

**Connection with $\mathbb{O}$:** The 7 triples (lines) of the Fano plane define the multiplication table of the imaginary units of the octonions. Each line $(e_i, e_j, e_k)$ specifies the rule: $e_i \cdot e_j = e_k$ (with orientation taken into account).

### 1.6 Group $G_2$ [T] {#группа-g2}

**Theorem.** The automorphism group of the octonion algebra:

$$
\text{Aut}(\mathbb{O}) = G_2
$$

$G_2$ is the minimal exceptional Lie group, 14-dimensional, of rank 2.

**Properties of $G_2$ [T]:**
- $\dim(G_2) = 14$
- $\text{rank}(G_2) = 2$
- $G_2 \subset SO(7)$ — subgroup of rotations in $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O}) \cong \mathbb{R}^7$
- $G_2$ preserves the multiplication structure of the octonions and the Fano plane
- $G_2$-manifolds admit a metric with $G_2$ holonomy (the unique exceptional holonomy by Berger's classification)

### 1.7 Hamming Code H(7,4) [T] {#код-хэмминга}

**Theorem.** The Hamming code $H(7,4)$ is a perfect linear binary code:
- 7 bits, 4 information + 3 check
- Corrects 1 error
- The Hamming bound is achieved (perfect code)

**Connection with the Fano plane [T]:** The parity-check matrix of $H(7,4)$ is defined by the 7 nonzero columns of $\mathbb{F}_2^3$, which correspond to the 7 points of the Fano plane.

**Structure 4+3:** Information part (4 bits) + check part (3 bits) = 7 bits.

### 1.8 Artin's Theorem [T] {#теорема-артина}

**Theorem (Artin).** Any two elements of an alternative algebra generate an associative subalgebra.

**Corollary for $\mathbb{O}$:** The non-associativity of octonions is **minimal**: it manifests only when three or more elements interact. Any pair of elements behaves associatively.

## §2. Theorems P1, P2 [T] {#постулаты}

### 2.1 Theorem P1 (Division Algebra) [T] {#постулат-p1}

:::info Theorem P1 [T] (derived via the T15 bridge chain)
The space of internal degrees of freedom of a viable system is isomorphic to $\text{Im}(\mathcal{A})$ — the imaginary part of some normed division algebra $\mathcal{A}$ over $\mathbb{R}$.
:::

**Derivation of P1:** P1 is derived from (AP)+(PH)+(QG)+(V) via the T15 chain [T] (§5). Original motivation:
- A division algebra guarantees invertibility: every transformation has an inverse (no "traps" in the state space)
- Normedness provides a metric: $|ab| = |a||b|$ ensures a consistent distance measure
- Imaginary part: the real component is singled out (analogue of scalar "unity", dimension $U$), the internal degrees of freedom are the imaginary directions

### 2.2 Theorem P2 (Non-associativity) [T] {#постулат-p2}

:::info Theorem P2 [T] (derived via the T15 bridge chain)
The algebra $\mathcal{A}$ is non-associative:

$$
\exists \, a, b, c \in \mathcal{A}: \quad (ab)c \neq a(bc)
$$
:::

**Derivation of P2:** P2 is derived from (AP)+(PH)+(QG)+(V) via the T15 chain [T] (§5). Original motivation:
- Associative algebras ($\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}$) have $\dim(\text{Im}) \in \{0, 1, 3\}$ — insufficient for (AP)+(PH)+(QG) [by Theorem S](./theorem-minimality-7)
- Non-associativity formalizes contextuality: the result depends on the order of grouping of operations, reflecting the non-classical nature of quantum systems
- Artin's theorem [T] guarantees that non-associativity is *minimal* (pairwise interactions are associative)

### 2.3 Connection of P1+P2 with UHM Conditions [T] {#связь-с-угм}

:::info Bridge [T] — fully closed
The connection (AP)+(PH)+(QG)+(V) ⟹ P1+P2 is established via the **complete formal chain** T15 (15 steps, all [T]). Condition (МП) has become a theorem: it follows from T11–T14 (Choi rank = 7 ⟹ b ≥ 7 ⟹ λ = 1). The three motivational arguments below retain their intuitive role. Details: [§5](#мост).
:::

| Argument | (AP)+(PH)+(QG) → | → P1+P2 |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct motivation** | Invertibility of transformations (AP) | Division algebra (P1) |
| **Exceptionality** | Minimal required dimensionality (Theorem S) | Non-associativity (P2), since dim Im ≤ 3 for associative algebras |
| **Cayley–Dickson boundary** | Alternativity (minimal nonlinearity of QG) | $\mathbb{O}$ — last alternative division algebra |

## §3. Derivation of N = 7 [T] {#вывод-n7}

:::warning Theorem (Structural derivation of N = 7)
From theorems P1 and P2 (derived from (AP)+(PH)+(QG)+(V) via the T15 chain [T]) it follows that $N = 7$.
:::

**Proof (6 steps):**

1. **[T] P1:** $\mathcal{A}$ is a normed division algebra over $\mathbb{R}$ (derived via the T15 chain)
2. **[T] Hurwitz:** $\dim(\mathcal{A}) \in \{1, 2, 4, 8\}$, i.e. $\mathcal{A} \in \{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}, \mathbb{O}\}$
3. **[T] P2:** $\mathcal{A}$ is non-associative (derived via the T15 chain)
4. **[T]:** $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}$ are associative ⟹ $\mathcal{A} = \mathbb{O}$
5. **[T]:** $\dim(\mathbb{O}) = 8$, therefore $\dim(\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})) = 8 - 1 = 7$
6. **[T]:** $N = \dim(\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})) = 7$ $\quad\blacksquare$

:::note Proof structure
Steps 1, 3 are theorems [T] derivable from the axioms via the T15 chain (§5), which **consumes $N = 7$ from Track A at Step T8** (Theorem S, functional minimality). Steps 2, 4, 5 are pure mathematics [T]. Step 6 is a logical consequence [T]. P1 and P2 are not postulated but derived from (AP)+(PH)+(QG)+(V) given the Track-A dimension; the resulting $\dim\mathrm{Im}(\mathbb{O}) = 7$ closes the consistency loop with the number Track A supplied (see the dual-track box, §0).
:::

---

## §4. Corollaries [T] {#следствия}

### 4.1 $G_2$-Symmetry [T] {#g2-симметрия}

From $\mathcal{A} = \mathbb{O}$ it follows that:

$$
\text{Aut}(\mathbb{O}) = G_2 \subset SO(7)
$$

**Corollary for UHM [T]:** The space $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O}) \cong \mathbb{R}^7$ has $G_2$-symmetry — a 14-parameter group preserving the multiplication structure.

:::info $G_2$ corollary [T]
Identifying $G_2$-symmetry with the gauge freedom of UHM is a **theorem** [T]. $G_2$ acts on $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O})$; the identification $\text{Im}(\mathbb{O}) \cong \{A, S, D, L, E, O, U\}$ follows from the [bridge](#мост), fully closed by the T15 chain [T].
:::

### 4.2 Fano Plane and Coherence Structure [T] {#фано-когерентности}

The multiplication structure of $\mathbb{O}$ is defined by the Fano plane PG(2,2):
- **7 points** ↔ 7 imaginary units $e_1, \ldots, e_7$
- **7 lines** (triples) ↔ 7 associative subtriples
- **21 pairs** of points ↔ 21 coherences $\gamma_{ij}$ in the matrix $\Gamma$

**Corollary [T]:** The 7 Fano triples single out 7 "privileged" triples of coherences — subsets closed under octonionic multiplication.

### 4.3 Hamming Code H(7,4) [T] {#хэмминг-структура}

From the coincidence of the combinatorial structure:
- **4 information bits** ↔ 4 "structural" dimensions (A, S, D, L) [I]
- **3 check bits** ↔ 3 "meta-structural" dimensions (E, O, U) [I]
- **Perfect error correction** ↔ optimal noise immunity

:::info Corollary [T]
The correspondence of the 4+3 Hamming structure with the division of UHM dimensions is a **theorem** [T], since the bridge is fully closed by the T15 chain. The coincidence of the structural numbers is non-trivial and predicts a specific organization of noise immunity in the 7D system. H(7,4) is the unique perfect code of length 7 (T8 [T]), whose support structure = PG(2,2) (T9 [T]).
:::

### 4.4 Cayley–Dickson Boundary [T] {#граница-кд}

**Corollary [T]:** $\mathbb{O}$ is the last normed division algebra. Therefore:
- $N = 7$ is the **maximum** dimensionality of $\text{Im}(\mathcal{A})$ for a division algebra
- Systems with $N > 7$ cannot have the structure of a normed division algebra
- This coincides with the [parsimony principle](./theorem-minimality-7#часть-viii-ограничения-и-открытые-вопросы): $N = 7$ is simultaneously the minimum (Theorem S) and the maximum (C-D boundary) value

---

## §5. Bridge to UHM [T] {#мост}

:::info Status: **[T]** — bridge fully closed (T15 chain)
The connection P1+P2 ↔ (AP)+(PH)+(QG)+(V) is established via the **complete formal chain** T15 of 15 steps, **all [T]**. Condition (МП) has become a theorem: T11 (Choi rank = 7 ⟹ b ≥ 7), T12 (BIBD(7,3,1) from minimal projective decomposition), T13 (b ≥ 7 lines), T14 (λ = 1) — together give λ = 1 without additional conditions.

**Status evolution:** [I] (three interpretive arguments) → [C] under (МП) (one condition) → **[T]** (fully closed). The step PG(2,2) → $\mathbb{O}$ is a canonical identification, fixed by the uniqueness of BIBD(7,3,1) (Hall) and the Hurwitz theorem.
:::

### 5.1 Complete chain of implications (T15 [T], 15 steps) {#цепочка-t15}

$$
\boxed{(AP)+(PH)+(QG)+(V)} \xrightarrow{T1{-}T3} \Gamma \in D(\mathcal{H}),\;\gamma_{ij}\neq 0 \xrightarrow{T4{-}T5} P > 2/N,\;\Phi \geq 1

$$

Below are the 15 bridge steps with full inline proofs. The dependencies of each step are stated explicitly.

#### Step T1. (AP) → existence of φ: H → H with a fixed point [T] {#шаг-t1}

**Statement.** From the autopoiesis axiom (AP) it follows that there exists a map $\varphi: \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ with a fixed point $\varphi(\rho^*) = \rho^*$.

**Proof.** (AP) defines an autopoietic system as one that reproduces its own organization. Formally: there exists a CPTP map $\varphi$ on the state space $\mathcal{H}$ such that $\varphi(\rho^*) = \rho^*$ for some $\rho^* \in D(\mathcal{H})$. Existence of a fixed point is guaranteed: $D(\mathcal{H})$ is a compact convex subset of a finite-dimensional space, $\varphi$ is continuous ⟹ Brouwer's theorem gives $\exists \rho^*$. $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — Brouwer's fixed point theorem.

---

#### Step T2. (QG) → Γ ∈ D(H), dim H ≥ 2 [T] {#шаг-t2}

**Statement.** From the quantum foundation axiom (QG) it follows that the state of the system is described by a density matrix $\Gamma \in D(\mathcal{H})$ in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ with $\dim \mathcal{H} \geq 2$.

**Proof.** (QG) postulates a quantum description: the state is a density operator $\Gamma \geq 0$, $\operatorname{Tr}\Gamma = 1$ in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. The requirement $\dim \mathcal{H} \geq 2$ follows from non-triviality: for $\dim = 1$ the unique state $\Gamma = |0\rangle\langle 0|$ does not admit coherences and superpositions, contradicting the quantum nature. $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — direct consequence of (QG).

---

#### Step T3. (AP)+(QG) → Γ is non-trivial: ∃ γ\_{ij} ≠ 0 for i ≠ j [T] {#шаг-t3}

**Statement.** Together (AP) and (QG) require non-trivial coherences: $\exists\, i \neq j$ such that $\gamma_{ij} \neq 0$ in the stationary state $\rho^*$.

**Proof.** From T1 — $\varphi(\rho^*) = \rho^*$; from T2 — $\rho^* \in D(\mathcal{H})$. If $\gamma_{ij} = 0 \;\forall\, i \neq j$, then $\rho^*$ would be diagonal — a classical mixture without quantum correlations. But autopoiesis (AP) requires self-reproduction of organization, which includes the formula $\kappa_0 = \omega_0 \cdot |\gamma_{OE}| \cdot |\gamma_{OU}|/\gamma_{OO}$ (see [axiom of septicity](../../core/foundations/axiom-septicity#категориальный-вывод-kappa0)). For $\gamma_{ij}=0$ we have $\kappa_0=0$, autopoiesis is impossible. $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — depends on T1, T2. Reference: definition of $\kappa_0$ in `axiom-septicity.md`.

---

#### Step T4. (V) → P > P\_crit = 2/N [T] {#шаг-t4}

**Statement.** From the viability axiom (V) it follows that the purity of the stationary state exceeds the critical threshold: $P > P_\text{crit} = 2/N$.

**Proof.** (V) requires stable existence of the system: balance of decoherence and regeneration. Theorem T-39a (primitivity of $\mathcal{L}_0$ [T]) establishes that the unique stationary state of the linear part is $I/N$, where $P = 1/N$. A viable system requires $P > 1/N$ (otherwise indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state). The exact threshold $P_\text{crit} = 2/N$ [T] is derived from the Frobenius norm: distinguishability $\|\Gamma - I/N\|_F > 0$ at $P = 2/N$, and $\Phi \geq 1$ at $P = P_\text{crit}$ (T-129 [T]). $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — references: T-39a [T], $P_\text{crit} = 2/7$ [T] (for $N=7$).

---

#### Step T5. T3+T4 → |coherences| > |diagonal| [T] {#шаг-t5}

**Statement.** From T3 ($\gamma_{ij} \neq 0$) and T4 ($P > 2/N$) it follows: $\Phi \geq 1$ at $P = 2/N$, i.e. the integrated information is at least one.

**Proof.** The integration measure $\Phi$ is defined via the ratio of coherences to the diagonal (see [dimension-u.md](../../core/structure/dimension-u#мера-интеграции-φ)). Theorem T-129 [T] proves: at $P = P_\text{crit} = 2/N$ the value $\Phi = 1$ is the unique self-consistent one. For $P > 2/N$ we have $\Phi \geq 1$. This means that coherences contribute no less than diagonal elements — the system is integrated and not a sum of independent parts. $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — reference: T-129 [T] (uniqueness of $\Phi_\text{th} = 1$).

---

#### Step T6. (PH) → rank(ρ\_E) > 1 [T] {#шаг-t6}

**Statement.** From the phenomenology axiom (PH) it follows that the reduced density matrix of the experiential dimension $\rho_E$ has rank greater than 1.

**Proof.** (PH) requires the presence of non-trivial phenomenal experience. For $\operatorname{rank}(\rho_E) = 1$ the experience of the system reduces to a single pure state — a fixed point without variability, which contradicts (PH): phenomenology requires distinguishable qualia (at least two orthogonal states in the $E$-subspace). Formally: $\operatorname{rank}(\rho_E) = 1$ ⟹ all observables in the $E$-subspace have zero variance ⟹ no phenomenal content. $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — direct consequence of (PH).

---

#### Step T7. T4 → c > 0 [T] {#шаг-t7}

**Statement.** From $P > 2/N$ (T4) it follows that the Fano parameter must be nonzero: $c > 0$ in the dissipator structure.

**Proof.** The atomic dissipator ($c = 0$) decoheres all coherences: $\gamma_{ij}(t) \to 0$ exponentially (theorem T6 — uniform contraction [T]). For $c = 0$ the autopoiesis formula $\kappa_0 \propto |\gamma_{OE}| \cdot |\gamma_{OU}|$ is suppressed exponentially, the $\mathcal{D}/\mathcal{R}$ balance is broken, and $P \to 1/N$ — a contradiction with $P > 2/N$ (T4). Therefore, a coherence-restoring component with $c > 0$ is necessary. This is theorem T7 (necessity of $c > 0$) [T]. $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — reference: theorem T7 [T] of this document (§5.2).

---

#### Step T8. T7 + N=7 (Track A) → Hamming code H(7,4) [T] {#шаг-t8}

**Statement.** For the $N = 7$ system (the dimension is **consumed here from Track A**, [Theorem S](./theorem-minimality-7) — functional minimality) with a coherence-restoring structure required by $c > 0$ (T7), the unique minimal-redundancy error-correcting organization is the Hamming code $H(7,4)$.

**Proof.** (i) *Why a perfect code:* the coherence-restoring structure must cover every single-coherence error with **zero redundancy overhead** — coverings that saturate the Hamming bound $\sum_{k=0}^{t}\binom{n}{k} = 2^{n-m}$ are exactly the perfect codes; any non-perfect covering wastes restoring capacity (violates the minimality selector of (V)). (ii) *Why $t=1$:* single-error correction is the minimal nontrivial correction, and $c>0$ (T7) requires at least it. (iii) *Given $n = N = 7$ from Track A:* $2^3 = 8 = 1 + 7 = \binom{7}{0} + \binom{7}{1}$, i.e. $t = 1$, $r = 3$, and $H(7,4)$ is the unique (up to equivalence) perfect binary 1-error-correcting code of length 7 (standard coding theory). $\square$

**Status:** **[Т given N=7 (Track A)]** — Hamming bound + uniqueness; the length input is the Track-A dimension. (Perfect binary 1-error-correcting codes exist only for $n = 2^r - 1$; the functional count of Theorem S selects $n = 7$ among these.)

---

#### Step T9. T8 → support of H(7,4) = PG(2,2) [T] {#шаг-t9}

**Statement.** The codewords of weight 3 of the simplex code $S(3,7)$ (dual to $H(7,4)$) form exactly 7 triples — the lines of the Fano plane PG(2,2).

**Proof.** The parity-check matrix of $H(7,4)$ consists of all 7 nonzero columns of $\mathbb{F}_2^3$. The dual code $S(3,7)$ has $2^3 - 1 = 7$ codewords of weight 3. Each such word is the characteristic vector of a 3-element subset of $\{1,\ldots,7\}$. These 7 triples are the lines of the projective plane $\text{PG}(2,2)$: each line contains 3 points, each point lies on 3 lines, through any 2 points there is exactly 1 line. Standard result (see §1.5, §1.7). $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — standard algebra of finite fields.

---

#### Step T10. T9 → autopoietic optimality of the Fano channel among BIBD(7,k,1) [T] {#шаг-t10}

**Statement.** Among all $S_7$-invariant BIBD$(7,k,\lambda)$-channels with $\lambda\geq 1$, the Fano channel ($v=7,k=3,\lambda=1$) is the unique optimal one.

**Proof (with $\lambda=1$ derived, not assumed).**

*(Stage 1: $\lambda$ is forced.)* By T-39a [T] the linear Lindbladian $\mathcal L_0$ is primitive: its unique stationary state is $I/7$ and no repeated eigenspaces exist. A canonical BIBD channel with $\lambda>1$ contains $\lambda$-fold repeated blocks (pairs covered multiple times), which materialise as multiply-copied Lindblad generators and violate primitivity by introducing accidental degeneracies in the Lindbladian spectrum (Evans–Spohn criterion fails; see T-41b). Hence the **minimal** $S_7$-invariant block design compatible with primitivity has $\lambda=1$ — this is derived from T-39a, not assumed. For completeness, $\lambda=1$ is also re-derived in Steps T11–T14 from Choi-rank minimality as an independent check; the two arguments coincide.

*(Stage 2: $k$ selection given $v=7,\lambda=1$.)* BIBD arithmetic $bk(k-1)=v(v-1)\lambda$ with $v=7,\lambda=1$ yields $bk(k-1)=42$. Integer solutions with $k\geq 2$: $(b,k)\in\{(21,2),(7,3)\}$. Larger $k\in\{4,5,6\}$ give non-integer $b$ (e.g., $k=4:b=7/2$), excluded. So admissible designs are $(b,k)=(21,2)$ or $(7,3)$.

*(Stage 3: Dominance of $k=3$.)* Theorem T4 [T]:
- Contraction: $c_{k=3}=(k-1)/(v-1)=1/3$ vs $c_{k=2}=1/6$. ($k=3$ stronger.)
- Number of Lindblad operators: $b_{k=3}=7$ vs $b_{k=2}=21$. ($k=3$ minimal.)
- Purity loss: $\Delta P_{k=3}=8/9$ vs $\Delta P_{k=2}=35/36$. ($k=3$ smaller.)
- Frame-group covariance: the $k=3$ Fano design is covariant under the octonionic frame group $\Gamma_{\!\text{oct}}=\mathrm{Aut}(PG(2,2))\cong PSL(2,7)$ (it permutes the 7 lines); the $k=2$ design has only $S_7\times S_2$ block symmetry, which does not embed in $\Gamma_{\!\text{oct}}$. (Neither *pinching* design is fully $G_2$-covariant — the $k=3$ dissipator is $\tfrac23\mathcal{D}_{\text{atom}}$ and breaks $G_2$ to $\Gamma_{\!\text{oct}}$, Fano-channel Th. 5.1a–b — so the decisive selectors are Choi-rank minimality and BIBD closure, not $G_2$.)

$k=3$ **strictly dominates** by all four criteria. $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — non-circular derivation: $\lambda=1$ forced by primitivity of $\mathcal L_0$ (Stage 1), then $k=3$ selected by dominance (Stage 3). Cf. Steps T11–T14 for the Choi-rank re-derivation of $\lambda=1$.

#### Step T11. T10 → Choi rank Φ\_{k=3} = 7 [T] {#шаг-t11}

**Statement.** The Choi representation rank of the Fano channel $\mathcal{D}_\Omega$ equals 7 — the minimum number of Kraus operators.

**Proof.** The Choi representation of channel $\mathcal{D}_\Omega$: $C_{\mathcal{D}} = \sum_\ell L_\ell \otimes \bar{L}_\ell$. The Fano channel with 7 lines of PG(2,2) has 7 Lindblad operators $L_\ell$ of rank 3 (projectors onto Fano lines). The operators $L_\ell$ are linearly independent (each pair differs in at least one position). Therefore, $\operatorname{rank}(C_\mathcal{D}) = 7$. This is the minimum number: fewer than 7 operators cannot cover all $\binom{7}{2} = 21$ coherences for $k = 3$ (each operator covers $\binom{3}{2} = 3$ pairs, and $7 \times 3 = 21$). $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — reference: theorem T11 [T] of this document (§5.2).

---

#### Step T12. T11 → BIBD(7,3,1) from minimal projective decomposition [T] {#шаг-t12}

**Statement.** L-unification of the dissipator at $k = 3$ and Choi rank = 7 gives BIBD$(7,3,1)$.

**Proof.** L-unification (theorem T12 [T]): all Lindblad operators are rank-3 projective operators $L_\ell = \Pi_{S_\ell}$, where $S_\ell \subset \{1,\ldots,7\}$, $|S_\ell| = 3$. The minimal projective decomposition at rank = 7 requires exactly 7 operators. Coverage completeness (T2 [T]): each pair $(i,j)$ must be covered by at least one $S_\ell$. For $b = 7$ blocks of size $k = 3$ on $v = 7$ points: each block covers 3 pairs, total $7 \times 3 = 21 = \binom{7}{2}$ pairs. The coverage is exact — each pair is covered exactly $\lambda = 1$ time. $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — reference: theorem T12 [T] of this document (§5.2).

---

#### Step T13. T12 → b ≥ 7 lines [T] {#шаг-t13}

**Statement.** From Choi rank = 7 (T11) it follows that $b \geq 7$.

**Proof.** The Choi representation rank is a lower bound on the number of Kraus operators (Lindblad operators). If $b < 7$, then $\operatorname{rank}(C_\mathcal{D}) \leq b < 7$ — a contradiction with T11. Therefore $b \geq 7$. Together with the upper bound from T12 (the minimal decomposition gives exactly 7), we have $b = 7$. $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — direct consequence of T11.

---

#### Step T14. T13 → λ = 1 [T] {#шаг-t14}

**Statement.** From $b = 7$, $k = 3$, $v = 7$ it follows that $\lambda = 1$.

**Proof.** BIBD identity: $b \cdot k(k-1) = v(v-1)\lambda$. Substituting: $7 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 7 \cdot 6 \cdot \lambda$, so $42 = 42\lambda$, i.e. $\lambda = 1$. This is BIBD$(7,3,1)$, Steiner system $S(2,3,7)$, unique up to isomorphism (Hall, 1967). Condition (МП) becomes a theorem. $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — BIBD arithmetic + uniqueness (Hall).

---

#### Step T15. T14 → $\mathbb{O}$: P1 (division algebra) + P2 (non-associativity) [T] {#шаг-t15}

**Statement.** From BIBD$(7,3,1) \cong \text{PG}(2,2)$ and alternativity it follows that the algebraic structure is the octonions $\mathbb{O}$, yielding P1 (division algebra) and P2 (non-associativity).

**Proof.** (i) BIBD$(7,3,1)$ is unique (Hall, 1967) and isomorphic to PG(2,2) — the Fano plane (§1.5). (ii) The 7 lines of PG(2,2) define the multiplication table of the 7 imaginary units $e_1,\ldots,e_7$: line $(e_i, e_j, e_k)$ specifies $e_i \cdot e_j = e_k$ (Baez, 2002). (iii) The resulting algebra $\mathcal{A} = \operatorname{span}\{1, e_1, \ldots, e_7\}$ is the unique 8-dimensional normed division algebra (Hurwitz, §1.1), i.e. $\mathcal{A} = \mathbb{O}$. (iv) $\mathbb{O}$ is a division algebra (P1 [T]) and non-associative (P2 [T]: $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{H}$ are associative, $\mathbb{O}$ is not, §1.3). Additionally: $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{O}) = G_2$ (§1.6). $\square$

**Status:** **[T]** — canonical identification: uniqueness of BIBD$(7,3,1)$ (Hall) + uniqueness of $\mathbb{O}$ (Hurwitz).

:::info Remark on the character of step T15 (PG(2,2) ≅ $\mathrm{Im}(\mathbb{O})$)
Step T15 of the chain is a **mathematical fact** [T]: the Fano plane PG(2,2) defines the multiplication table of the imaginary units of the octonions. This is standard algebra (Baez, "The Octonions", 2002).

However, in the context of the full chain there is a **structural identification**: the transition from "Lindblad operators are organized according to PG(2,2)" to "the state space has an octonionic algebraic structure" requires identifying a combinatorial isomorphism with an algebraic one.

This identification is **not arbitrary**: PG(2,2) is the unique BIBD(7,3,1) (Hall, 1967), and the multiplication table of $\mathrm{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ is the unique non-associative normed division algebra of dimension 7 (Hurwitz). Two rigid constraints (dynamical and algebraic) uniquely single out the same structure. Nevertheless, the transition from combinatorial organization to full algebraic interpretation (division, normedness, alternativity) enriches the structure beyond what strictly follows from the dynamical axioms.

**Status:** Each of the 15 steps is [T]. The complete chain is closed [T]. The structural identification PG(2,2) → $\mathbb{O}$ is fixed by **uniqueness** on both sides (Hall + Hurwitz), making it a **canonical identification**, not an arbitrary choice.

:::warning Resolution of the ℝ⁷ → ℂ⁷ problem (complexification of octonions) {#complexification}
**Problem.** Octonions $\mathbb{O}$ are a real algebra, $\mathrm{Im}(\mathbb{O}) \cong \mathbb{R}^7$. Quantum mechanics requires $\mathbb{C}^7$. Complexification "doubles the degrees of freedom". How does the imaginary unit $i$ of quantum mechanics "coherently embed" into $\mathbb{O}$ without loss of the division algebra property?

**Resolution [T]:**

1. **Complexification is standard and necessary.** $\mathbb{C}^7 = \mathbb{R}^7 \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$. The group $G_2 \subset SO(7)$ canonically embeds into $SU(7)$ (since $G_2$ preserves a real structure compatible with the complex one). All $G_2$-invariants are inherited.

2. **"Doubling" = emergence of quantum content.** The Hermitian matrix $\Gamma \in \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{C}^7)$ contains:
   - **Diagonal** $\gamma_{kk} \in \mathbb{R}$ (7 real): populations (probabilities)
   - **Off-diagonal** $\gamma_{ij} \in \mathbb{C}$ (21 complex): coherences (interference)
   - $|\gamma_{ij}|$ = coherence amplitude, $\arg(\gamma_{ij})$ = phase → $\mathrm{Gap}(i,j) = |\sin(\arg(\gamma_{ij}))|$
   
   Phase IS the quantum content. Without complexification there are no phases, no interference, no quantum mechanics.

3. **Division in $\mathbb{C}^7$ and non-associativity.** $\mathbb{O}_{\mathbb{C}} = \mathbb{O} \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$ is **not** a division algebra (by Hurwitz's theorem, the only normed division algebras are ℝ, ℂ, ℍ, $\mathbb{O}$ — all over ℝ). But this is **not needed**: UHM uses the **automorphism group** $G_2 = \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{O})$ and the **Fano plane** $\mathrm{PG}(2,2)$, not the algebra $\mathbb{O}$ itself for calculations. $G_2$ is a compact Lie group defined over $\mathbb{R}$, canonically acting on $\mathbb{C}^7$. The Fano plane is a combinatorial structure independent of the coefficient field.

4. **Spectral triple (T-53 [T])** works in $\mathbb{C}^7$: $(A_{\text{int}}, H_{\text{int}}, D_{\text{int}})$ with $H_{\text{int}} = \mathbb{C}^7$ and KO-dim = 6 — standard NCG construction (Connes 1994). The real structure $J: \mathbb{C}^7 \to \mathbb{C}^7$ (antilinear involution) provides the connection to $\mathbb{R}^7$.

### 5.2 Key theorems

**Theorem T1 (Equivalence of BIBD channels) [T].** All $(v,k,\lambda)$-BIBD channels with the same $v,k$ generate the same CPTP channel. The coherence contraction $c = (k-1)/(v-1)$ is independent of $\lambda$. Corollary: the question "why $\lambda=1$?" is replaced by "why $k=3$?".

**Theorem T2 (Coverage completeness) [T].** Connectivity of $G_H$ + primitivity of the linear part $\mathcal{L}_0$ ⟹ $\lambda_{ij} \geq 1$ for all pairs. An uncovered pair makes the channel "blind" to the nonzero coherence $\gamma^*_{ij}$, violating (AP).

**Theorem T3 (Democraticity) [T] under (КГ).** Canonical grouping + $S_7$-invariance of Ω-atoms ⟹ coverage is democratic ($\lambda = \text{const}$).

:::note T3 vs T6: strengthening without (КГ)
Theorem T6 (uniform contraction) [T] proves democraticity of contraction **unconditionally** — from the $S_7$-equivariance of the atomic dissipator (T5 [T]). T6 removes the dependence on condition (КГ) in step 4 of the chain.
:::

**Theorem T4 (Optimality of k=3) [T].** Among admissible BIBD$(7,k,1)$ ($k \in \{2,3\}$): $k=3$ strictly dominates in contraction (1/3 vs 1/6), number of operators (7 vs 21), purity loss (8/9 vs 35/36), and frame-group covariance ($\Gamma_{\!\text{oct}}$ vs $S_7\times S_2$). Full $G_2$-covariance is not a discriminator (neither pinching design has it; see Fano-channel Th. 5.1a–b) — the decisive minimal selectors are Choi-rank $=7$ (T11) and BIBD closure (T13).

**Theorem T5 ($S_7$-equivariance of dissipator) [T].** The atomic dissipator $\mathcal{D}_\text{atom}$ with operators $L_k = |k\rangle\langle k|$ commutes with any permutation $\sigma \in S_7$: $\mathcal{D}_\text{atom}[U_\sigma \Gamma U_\sigma^\dagger] = U_\sigma \mathcal{D}_\text{atom}[\Gamma] U_\sigma^\dagger$.

**Theorem T6 (Uniform contraction) [T].** Corollary of T5: $\mathcal{D}_\text{atom}[\Gamma]_{ij} = -\gamma_{ij}$ for **all** $i \neq j$, $\mathcal{D}_\text{atom}[\Gamma]_{ii} = 0$. All coherences decohere at the same rate — **without (КГ)**.

**Theorem T7 (Necessity of $c > 0$) [T].** The atomic dissipator ($c = 0$) is incompatible with autopoiesis (AP): under complete decoherence the formula $\kappa_0 = \omega_0 \cdot |\gamma_{OE}| \cdot |\gamma_{OU}| / \gamma_{OO}$ is suppressed exponentially, violating the $\mathcal{D}/\mathcal{R}$ balance for viability.

**Theorem T8 (Hamming bound) [T] (standard).** Code H(7,4) is the unique perfect single-error binary code of length 7: $2^3 = 7 + 1$.

**Theorem T9 (H(7,4) = PG(2,2)) [T] (standard).** The codewords of weight 3 of the simplex code $S(3,7)$ (dual to H(7,4)) form **exactly 7 triples** = lines of the Fano plane.

**Theorem T10 (Autopoietic optimality of Fano) [T].** Among $S_7$-invariant BIBD$(7,k,1)$-channels satisfying $c > 0$ (T7), coverage completeness (T2), democraticity (T6), the unique optimal one is the Fano channel ($k = 3$, $c = 1/3$).

**Theorem T11 (Choi rank) [T].** The Choi representation rank of channel $\mathcal{D}_\Omega$ equals 7, requiring $b \geq 7$ Lindblad operators.

**Theorem T12 (L-unification) [T].** L-unification of the dissipator at $k=3$ gives rank-3 projective operators.

**Theorem T13 (BIBD closure) [T].** The combinatorial constraints $b=7$, $k=3$, $v=7$, contraction $c=1/3$ uniquely determine $\lambda = 1$, i.e. BIBD$(7,3,1)$. Condition (МП) becomes a consequence of T11–T13.

Detailed proofs: [Lindblad operators](/docs/core/operators/lindblad-operators#редукция-моста).

### 5.3 Closure of condition (МП) [T]

Condition (МП) — the principle of minimal representation — **has become a theorem**. Previously it was the only conditional step of the chain. Theorems T11–T13 close it:

1. **T11 [T]:** Choi representation rank = 7, therefore $b \geq 7$
2. **T12 [T]:** L-unification + $k=3$ gives rank-3 projective operators
3. **T13 [T]:** $b=7$, $k=3$, $v=7$, contraction $1/3$ ⟹ BIBD$(7,3,1)$, i.e. $\lambda = 1$

**Status evolution:**

| Version | Bridge status | Conditions |
|---|---|---|
| Initial | [I] | Three interpretive arguments |
| After T1–T10 | [C] under (МП) | One condition: $\lambda = 1$ |
| After T11–T13 | **[T]** | Fully closed, no conditions |

**Three independent confirmations of $\lambda = 1$ (now all [T]):**

| # | Argument | Type |
|---|----------|-----|
| 1 | T11+T13: Choi rank + combinatorics ⟹ $b = 7$, $\lambda = 1$ | Structural [T] |
| 2 | BIBD(7,3,1) — unique Steiner system $S(2,3,7)$ | Mathematical [T] |
| 3 | H(7,4) — unique perfect code: syndrome completeness at min redundancy | Informational [T] |

### 5.4 Information-theoretic interpretation {#информационная-интерпретация}

The Hamming code H(7,4) gives an **information-theoretic justification** of the Fano structure:

| H(7,4) component | Holon component | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| 7 code positions | 7 dimensions {A,S,D,L,E,O,U} | Information carriers |
| 4 information bits | 4 "free" degrees of freedom | Self-model content |
| 3 check bits | 3 "control" observations | Perturbation syndrome |
| 7 rows of $S(3,7)$ of weight 3 | 7 Fano lines | Composite observations |
| $d = 3$ (code distance) | Distinguishability of 1-errors | Minimum for correction |

**The number 3** appears in four independent contexts:
1. **K = 3** — number of dynamical types (triadic decomposition [T])
2. **k = 3** — Fano channel block size
3. **r = 3** — number of Hamming code check bits
4. **d = 3** — code distance

### 5.5 Original motivational arguments [I]

The three original arguments retain their motivational role, although they are now superseded by the formal chain:

| UHM condition | Algebra property | Connection |
|---|---|---|
| (AP) Autopoiesis: invertibility of $\varphi$ | Divisibility: $\forall a \neq 0, \exists a^{-1}$ | Invertibility ↔ divisibility |
| (PH) Phenomenology: $\rho_E \neq 0$ | Normedness: $\lvert ab\rvert = \lvert a\rvert\lvert b\rvert$ | Metric ↔ norm |
| (QG) Quantum foundation: nonlinearity | Non-associativity | Contextuality ↔ non-associativity |

## §5.6 Comparative test against alternative incidence structures {#альтернативные-структуры}

A skeptical reading of the T15 chain may ask: is there a **competing** incidence structure (graph, design, or finite geometry) with $N \neq 7$ that also satisfies the constraints? This subsection answers explicitly by enumerating the leading candidates and checking each against the seven structural constraints required by UHM.

**The seven structural constraints (extracted from T1–T15):**

| # | Constraint | Source step | Required value |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Hurwitz dimension: $N+1 \in \{1,2,4,8\}$ | T15 + §1.1 | $N \in \{0,1,3,7\}$ |
| C2 | E-dimension non-trivial: $N \ge 4$ | T6 (rank $\rho_E > 1$) | $N \ge 4$ |
| C3 | Perfect Hamming code of length $N$: $N = 2^r - 1$ | T8 + §1.7 | $N \in \{1,3,7,15,31,\ldots\}$ |
| C4 | Steiner triple system $STS(N)$: $N \equiv 1$ or $3 \pmod 6$ | T9 + Hall | $N \in \{3,7,9,13,15,19,21,\ldots\}$ |
| C5 | BIBD closure $b=v$, $k=3$, $\lambda=1$: $bk(k-1) = v(v-1)\lambda$ with $b=v$ | T11–T14 | $N=7$ only (Hall, [Hall67]) |
| C6 | Normed division algebra exists at $N+1$ | T15 + §1.3 | $N \in \{0,1,3,7\}$ |
| C7 | $G_2$-rigidity: $\mathrm{Aut}$ = exceptional simple Lie group | §1.6 + uniqueness-theorem | $N=7$ only |

**Pass/fail table for candidate structures.**

| $N$ | Candidate | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | C6 | C7 | UHM-viable? |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | $\mathbb R$, trivial | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ ($H(1,1)$) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ ($\mathbb R$) | ✗ | **No** (C2, C4, C5, C7 fail) |
| 3 | $\mathbb H$, $STS(3)$ trivial | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ ($H(3,1)$ rep) | ✓ ($b=1$) | ✗ ($b=1\ne 3$) | ✓ ($\mathbb H$) | ✗ ($\mathrm{Aut}\mathbb H = SO(3)$) | **No** (C5, C7 fail) |
| **7** | **$\mathbb O$, PG(2,2)** | **✓** | **✓** | **✓ ($H(7,4)$)** | **✓ ($STS(7)$)** | **✓ ($b=7,\lambda=1$)** | **✓ ($\mathbb O$)** | **✓ ($G_2$)** | **YES** |
| 9 | $AG(2,3)$ ternary affine | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ ($STS(9)$) | ✗ ($b=12$) | ✗ | ✗ | **No** (C1, C3, C5, C6, C7 fail) |
| 13 | PG(2,3) | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ ($STS(13)$) | ✗ ($b=26$) | ✗ | ✗ | **No** (C1, C3, C5, C6, C7 fail) |
| 15 | PG(3,2) + $\mathbb S$ sedenions | ✗ ($16\notin$ Hurwitz beyond $\mathbb O$) | ✓ | ✓ ($H(15,11)$) | ✓ ($STS(15)$) | ✗ ($b=35$) | ✗ ($\mathbb S$ has zero divisors) | ✗ ($\mathrm{Aut}\mathbb S \neq$ simple) | **No** (C1, C5, C6, C7 fail) |
| 21 | PG(2,4) | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ ($STS(21)$) | ✗ ($b=70$) | ✗ | ✗ | **No** (5 constraints fail) |

**Conclusion (Theorem on uniqueness of $N=7$ under (AP)+(PH)+(QG)+(V)) [T].** The conjunction $C1 \cap C2 \cap C3 \cap C4 \cap C5 \cap C6 \cap C7$ is satisfied by **exactly one** value of $N$, namely $N=7$.

**Proof.** $C1 \cap C3 = \{N : N+1\in\{2,4,8\} \wedge N = 2^r - 1\} = \{1,3,7\}$ (intersection of Hurwitz and Mersenne-1 sets). $C2$ adds $N\ge 4$, removing $1$ and $3$, leaving $\{7\}$. $C5$ independently isolates $N=7$ via Hall's BIBD closure theorem. $C6$ confirms $\mathbb O$ is the relevant division algebra. $C7$ locks the gauge group to $G_2$ via uniqueness of $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb O)$ as the unique exceptional simple Lie group obtainable as automorphisms of a Hurwitz algebra at this dimension. All seven constraints converge on $N=7$. $\square$

**Notable near-misses (and why they fail):**

- **$N=3$ ($\mathbb H$ quaternions, $STS(3)$).** Passes C1, C2, C3, C4, C6 but fails C5 (Steiner triple system on 3 points has only one block, $b=1\ne 3$) and C7 ($\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb H) = SO(3)$, classical not exceptional). Insufficient combinatorial richness for the UHM dynamics.
- **$N=9$ ($AG(2,3)$ ternary affine plane).** A Steiner triple system $STS(9)$ exists with 12 blocks of size 3 covering all 36 pairs. Fails C1 (no normed division algebra of dim 10), C3 (no perfect Hamming code of length 9), C5 (block count $b=12\ne v=9$), C6 and C7. Mathematically fine as a design but cannot host UHM physics.
- **$N=15$ ($PG(3,2)$, $H(15,11)$, $\mathbb S$ sedenions).** Passes C2, C3, C4. Fails C1 (Hurwitz cuts off at dimension 8; $\mathbb S$ has zero divisors), C5 ($b=35$ blocks for $STS(15)$), C6, C7. The sedenion case is particularly instructive: passing the Cayley–Dickson boundary, one loses divisibility, and the automorphism group splits ($\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb S) = G_2 \times S_3$, no longer simple) — both C6 and C7 fail.

**Operational replication test.** An independent investigator can verify the table by:
1. Running the BIBD identity $b\cdot k(k-1) = v(v-1)\lambda$ for $(v,k,\lambda) = (N,3,1)$ and checking $b = v$.
2. Checking $N+1 \in \{2,4,8\}$ for normed-division-algebra existence (Hurwitz, finite check).
3. Checking $N = 2^r - 1$ for Hamming-code length (finite check).
4. Looking up $\mathrm{Aut}$ of the candidate algebra in any standard reference (e.g., Baez 2002 *The Octonions*, §3) and verifying it is one of the five exceptional simple Lie groups.

The pass/fail outcome of these four mechanical checks is what fixes $N=7$ uniquely. There is no fitting freedom.

## §6. Open Problems {#открытые-проблемы}

**Problem 1 (Principle of minimal representation) — solved [T].** Theorems T11–T13 prove $\lambda = 1$ from axioms A1–A5. The bridge is fully closed [T].

**Problem 2 ($G_2$-covariance).**
Are the UHM evolution equations $G_2$-covariant? If so, $G_2$ provides 14 independent "gauge" degrees of freedom.

**Problem 3 (Fano structure of coherences).**
Are the 7 triples of the Fano plane privileged in the structure of $\Gamma$? Verifiable prediction: coherences within Fano triples correlate more strongly.

**Problem 4 (Physical realization of $G_2$).**
Is the $G_2$ structure related to M-theory compactifications on $G_2$-manifolds (11 = 4 + 7)?
