# UHM Theory Documentation

Documentation website for **Unitary Holonomic Monism (UHM)** — a formal theory of reality and consciousness.

## Overview

UHM describes the structure, dynamics, and phenomenology of reality through a single mathematical object — the Coherence Matrix (Γ).

Key concepts:
- **Holon** — minimal self-sufficient unit of reality
- **7 Dimensions** — A (Articulation), S (Structure), D (Dynamics), L (Logic), E (Experience), O (Ground), U (Unity)
- **Interiority Hierarchy** — L0 (interiority) → L1 (phenomenal geometry) → L2 (cognitive qualia)
- **Viability** — condition for system existence: P > P_crit = 2/7

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm start
```

Opens a local development server at `http://localhost:3000`. Changes are reflected live.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Generates static content in the `build` directory.

## Deployment

The site is deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).

Manual deployment:
```bash
GIT_USER=<username> npm run deploy
```
